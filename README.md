# ECDSADip

College project of 2023

This code is not written by me for references you can go to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-elliptic-curve-digital-signature-algorithm-ecdsa/ 

Explanation:

1: The python code first generates both the private key and the public key.

2: The calculation is then done by converting the message(as i take the message ECDSA Code by mee)  to an integer.

3: The hashing method is used to determine the values of r and s.

4: Then the signature process takes places

5: The ApplyDoubleAndAdd method is used to calculate the value of points p1 and p2.

6: The signature is valid if both points p1 and p2 are equal; else, it is invalid.
