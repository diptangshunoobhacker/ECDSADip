# ECDSADip

College project of 2023.

**Explanation:**

- The python code first generates both the private key and the public key.

- The calculation is then done by converting the message(as i take the message ECDSA Code by mee)  to an integer.

- The hashing method is used to determine the values of r and s.

- Then the signature process takes places.

- The ApplyDoubleAndAdd method is used to calculate the value of points p1 and p2.

- The signature is valid if both points p1 and p2 are equal; else, it is invalid.
